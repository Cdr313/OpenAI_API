# OpenAI_API
This Python script uses the OpenAI API to generate text based on user-provided prompts. The script prompts the user to enter a question, and then uses the ChatGPT API to generate a response with a maximum of 50 tokens. The script continues to prompt the user and generate text until the user types 'exit'.
